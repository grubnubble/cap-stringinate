- I also looked for different ways of looping through a dictionary, since that is the data structure I chose. I considered using tuples, but the dictionary solution came most easily to me, so I went with that. Here is the [source](https://realpython.com/iterate-through-dictionary-python/#iterating-through-items) I used for reviewing how to iterate through a python dictionary.
